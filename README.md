I used create-react-app for my base react app. I have not had the time to devote to Webpack yet, so went with that because it sets up a really useable React app that I can just modify to suit me.

For my css I used materialize-css. I used the buttons and the header from this package.

For navigation I used react-router-dom. It is the router package I am most comfortable with. I havent really used any others too much.
